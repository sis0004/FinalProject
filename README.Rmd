GEOG693 Final Project

### Purpose:
This project is designed to simplify analysis of lab analyzed major ion chemistry of acid saline lake waters. 

#### Research Questions:
1. How does pH affect chemistry? 
  - To answer this, we need to look at 1) the relationship between pH and aluminum, iron, and silica, as these three ions are hypothesized to be controlled by pH and 2) if there is any relationship between pH and rare earth elements or any other selected ions.  
2. How different are these salt lake waters from seawater?
  - To answer this, we will compare individual and average values of acid saline lake ion concentrations and compare them to average seawater composition.
