# Final Project
GEOG693 Final Project

### Purpose:
This project is designed to simplify analysis of lab analyzed major ion chemistry of acid saline lake waters. 

### Research Question:
How does pH affect chemistry? To answer this, we need to look at 

  1) the relationship between pH and aluminum, iron, and silica, as these three ions are hypothesized to be controlled by pH and 
  
  2) if there is any relationship between pH and rare earth elements or any other selected ions.  

### Languages Used:
 * R

### Requirements:
- Installation of R and RStudio
- Internet connection 

### Products:
1) A modified dataframe that eliminates values that have uncertainty and values that are below the reported detection threshold. 

2) A text file that reports average values of ions. 

3) A dataframe that combines Field Data and Lab Data for samples for further analysis and a dataframe of selected elements that less bulky.
  
4) Plots that show the relationship between major ions and pH, and between selected rare earth elements and pH. 

5) A study site map (with inset map) of acid saline lakes in Western Australia. 

### Example of plots produced

### Acknowledgements
* To my very, _very_ patient boyfriend who taught me how to effectively Google things. Cheers to surviving the greatest communication challenge we've faced yet.

### Notes to instructor:
- I deviated a bit from my project proposal (I hope this is ok!). Instead of comparing to seawater data and just making more plots, I chose to create a site map of the lakes in Western Australia. 
- Thank you for a great semester and so many new tools to use!
